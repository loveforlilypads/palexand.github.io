# Artists, Music and Gear

I keep a [blog](http://www.ittc.ku.edu/~alex/personal/music-blog/music-blog.php) where I describe some of the artists and music I listen
to and the stereo gear that I use for playback.I find it exceedingly
difficult to find new music that I enjoy. My interests are pretty
eclectic ranging from jazz through indie pop and folk to ska with
about everything in between, except what you hear on the
radio. Although the web has changed things for the better, it's still
difficult to find new artists that I like. I also tend to be a bit of
a gear-head - I like listening and learning about home audio gear. I
have also put together some advice for first time high-end stereo
buyers. To make a long story short, I'm a big fan of Bryston and
Classe amplification, Benchmark DACs, HeadRoom headphone amps and
Entymotic and Senheiser headphones. I also have Snell type C/V
speakers and CAL digital sources that I love, but both of those
companies have since been purchased and I'm not sure if and how they
have changed. Visit the blog and select the music keyword for artists
and music or the gear keyword for info on playback systems. Taste is
personal -- your mileage my vary.
