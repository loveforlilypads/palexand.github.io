title: Swing Low Magellan - Dirty Projectors
---

Just picked up Dirty Projectors' *Swing Low Magellan* last week and have
become completely smitten by the thing.  Funny thing that I've owned
*Bitte Orca* for quite some time and never really paid that much
attention to it.  Particularly surprising given all the rave reviews
it got.  I just didn't get it.  I think I get it now. 

Dirty Projectors is kind of a disjointed, pop/rock/alt band that seems
to not know what it is sometimes, but in a really good way.  I would
love to describe the first track on Swing Low Magellan, but I can't.
It alternates between screaming electric guitar and quiet, almost
chorale style chords and singing.  Don't know what to make of it, but
I do like it. 

Track 2, *About to Die*, is among my favorite songs on the album.  Think
reggae from space and you'll get an idea of what this is about.  The
bass and drum are almost difficult to follow until you think reggae.
Not literally, just in rhythmic feel.  Again with the nice, big chords
in the vocals and alternating rock/vocal kinds of things with the
constant rhythm tracks underneath.  It really doesn't sound much like
a track called *About to Die*, but the lyrics really are about that.  Really
nice. 

*Gun Has No Trigger* is quite similar.  If the Beatles had today's
technology back then, I'm guessing this would have appeared right
after *Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds* way back when.  Now Dirty
Projectors are no Beatles, but they sure are fun. 

Other favorites include *Just from Chevron* and *Impregnable*
Question. The former adds jangley electric guitar and sticks with
quite vocals throughout. 

I remember that I love dissonance, particularly in rhythms, and I
start to understand why I like this work and going back to Bitte Orca
why I like that as well.  Funny how that works.  I guess I was in a
different mood when I picked it up originally.  Highly original music
that is definitely worth your time.
