Shout out to Cowboy Indian Bear, a local Lawrence band who won the *Top
of the Hill* award for best local band.  I listened to their samples on
the LJW website with exceptionally low expectations.  Boy was I
surprised - this guys are awesome.  Very much a pop band with a bit of
twee that works very, very well.  Really great vocals and some serious
chops.  I don't think they're going to be local very long.  Major
props to these guys - I always root for local bands.
