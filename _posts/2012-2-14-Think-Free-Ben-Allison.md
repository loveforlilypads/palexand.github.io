title: Think Free - Ben Allison
---

Ben Allison is a bassist from Portland who was recommended to me by my
friend Jeff Lewis after he learned of Ari Hoenig from one of my posts.
It's great how that works, isn't it?  I've since invested in quite a
few of Ben Allison's projects and am a big fan. 

*Think Free* is the first of Allison's albums that I purchased and it
took a few listens to get into.  For me, this is actually a good sign
- *The Nightfly* and more recently *Beautiful Mechanical* are examples of
albums that I have long-term love for that were not instant hits for
me. 

The opening track, *Fred*, is an interesting tune that's difficult for
me to describe.  It's definitely a jazz track, but it feels to me like
the drummer is laying down a pop line.  The trumpet is absolutely
gorgeous and understated - I'm sure I could pick up the horn and play
the line right now.  However, it's absolutely perfect.  The song
reminds me of some of the work that Ginger Baker did when he headed in
a jazz direction.  The second track, *Platypus*, is just as good as
the first and in the same spirit.  The same general feel, but a bit
more uptempo.  Again an understated trumpet line with a kind of pop
drum track underneath. 

*Kramer vs. Kramer vs. Godzilla* takes things in a very different
 direction.  A bit more outside and electronic, but still fits what's
 going on with the album very well.  Still featuring the trumpet, but
 now with strings moving to the front. 

*Peace Pipe* is a wonderful track that has a nice, surprising change
 of pace in the middle.  It starts with a somewhat dissonant melody
 that makes you wonder what's coming. Then a gorgeous trumpet line
 emerges into a new melody that I really enjoy. *Peace Pipe* might be my
 favorite track on the album with *Fred* being right up there as well. 

Wonderful album by a wonderful artist.  I'm not sure who the trumpet
player is, but I definitely enjoy their work.
