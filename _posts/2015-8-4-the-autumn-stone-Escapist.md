title: the autumn stone - Escapists
---

*Escapists* present a nice fun album in *the autumn stone*.  A bit of chamber pop with just a twinge of ska - think The Aluminum Group sans electronics plus sax and you're close to the *Escapists* sound. Dreamy vocals, jangley guitars, good horns, nice harmonies and a great summer feel. I really dig the lead vocalist and the groovy bass and drums.  (And yes, groovy is the just right adjective here.) There is a nice consistency in the sound with a few surprises thrown in.

*Time is a River* is a kind of ska-inspired romp that isn't quite ska. Love the vocals and subtle harmony.  For some reason the sax sounds a bit wonky to me (see below), but I still dig the song and things only get better from here.

*Endless War* goes yet more ska starting something from the Mighty Mighty Bosstones songbook.  The vocals belie the intro in a kind of half-time understated way.  Then some nice guitar and bass work.  Again with the sax, but seems to work a bit better here.  I hit replay on this song a couple of times.

*End of Faith* wanders off in a different direction with a more rock tinged sound and a traditional alt-rock vibe.  Then comes *In with  the Out Crowd* and I really start to pay attention.  Nice uptempo dream-pop sound that is my favorite track on the album.  Everything comes together for *Escapists* here in just the right way.

Tempo goes down for *Sweet Libertine*, but still in the dream-pop sound.  Here's where my reference to The Aluminum Group comes from.  Back uptempo with *Spirit Shadow* with much more edge on the guitar and drums.  The style shift works really nicely for me, although *Spirit Shadow* doesn't stand out like *In with the Out Crowd* that I keep going back to.

*Ooh La La* takes things all the way back to the dream-pop sound of earlier tracks.  Nice kind of 50's vibe and the sax works well for me here.  The guitar sound is perfect and compliments the vocals.  Following nicely is *Creatures* that takes things down another notch and brings the vocals forward.  Segues nicely into *Dark Age* that closes the album on an uptempo note.  One of my favorite moments on the album at just the right time.

I love the transitions from style to style that *Escapists* use.  Makes for a great album listen rather than a song-by-song experience.  Only real critiques are intonation and recording of the winds, particularly the sax. Please tune the sax! A good recordist could help clean this up quickly. That said, I love a band with such great potential and I'd love to see these guys live.
