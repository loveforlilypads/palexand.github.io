title: At Filmore East - The Allman Brothers Band
---

Just a quick note about this album I just picked up on an impulse. I
didn't have any Allman Brothers in my collection and this came highly
recommended as one of the best live albums of all time. Holy crap is
that ever an understatement! Just finished up *In Memory of Elizabeth
Reed* an am in the middle of *You Don't Love Me*. I have never heard
anything like this. I mean I've heard a ton of music like this -
southern, guitar-based rock and roll - but never played like this. The
musicianship on every instrument is phenomenal. If you don't have this
album you need to. Now.
