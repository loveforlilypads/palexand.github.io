title: After Blue - Tierney Sutton
---
Tierney Sutton's *After Blue* is a collection of Joni Mitchell tunes
she performs with several backing ensembles including *The Turtle
Island Quartet*.  If you're not familiar with Sutton (I wasn't
before this) she typically does straight-ahead jazz vocal albums with a
mix of standards and original work.  I ran across her stuff before
making this purchase, but never bit. I will be going back and
listening again after this wonderful album.

Joni Mitchell is an interesting character.  If you ask most folks
about her, they immediately go to her folk music work.  Think *Big
Yellow Taxi* and *Both Sides Now*, both of which appear on this
album.  What many don't remember is that she worked as much with jazz
players as she did as a folk musician.  In fact, she was frustrated by
the label of a folk musician.  She had a wonderful relationship with
Charles Mingus and I have an album she did with a young Pat Metheny
and Jaco Pastorius.  *Don Juan's Reckless Daughter* is considered a
classic as is *Blue* among many others.

I guess what I'm getting at is that if you make a jazz album of Joni
Mitchell tunes you have quite a bit to work with.  After much ado and
intro, let me say that Tierney Sutton does absolutely brilliant work with
Mitchell's songs.  They are definitely sung in a wonderful jazz style,
but she goes to great effort to preserve the structure and integrity
of each song.  If you care at all for vocal jazz, this is an album you
really must own.

*All I Want* opens the album and is a wonderful rendition of the
classic Mitchell tune.  Sutton captures Mitchell's sweet, soaring
vocal style that characterizes this tune.  Backing by *Turtle Island*
is wonderful and compliments Sutton's vocals.

*Big Yellow Taxi* is a virtual requirement for covering Joni
Mitchell.  It's my second favorite track on the album with Sutton
romping over the changes of a classic folk tune.  She takes liberties
with the intro doing a nice little skat to open.  Backed only by a
snare and kick drum, she launches into the verse with a nice jazzy
take.  Rather than kicking in a full ensemble, she stays with only
the drum backing her voice and throws in some nice improv work.  I
keep waiting for the full ensemble to appear, but it never does.  And
it always works.  Exceptionally nice track.

*Answer Me My Love* opens with a beautiful solo classical guitar and
is as simple as a song can be.  Sutton does a nice, subtle solo in the
middle bars that shows great restraint in a way that only someone
confident in their craft can do.  *April In Paris* is similar,
wandering closer to a jazz ballad away from Mitchell's more folksy
sound.

The only duet on the album is with Al Jarreau on *Be Cool* where
Jarreau's influence definitely shines through.  A flute solo and nice
organ backing give this the sound of something that could easily
appear on any of Jarreau's great albums.  In the middle of the song one
doesn't need to be told who the second vocalist is!

*Blue* has a neo-classical feel too it, reminding me of something that
*yMusic* might do or something that would appear on a *Turtle Island*
*solo album.

Sutton's version of *Both Sides Now* is simply breathtaking. It is
perfection in terms of style, her vocals, and the cello work behind
her.  Sutton sings simply - no pyrotechnics - and beautifully.  Just
like Mitchell did with the original.  Mark Summer
of *Turtle Island Quartet* provides cello behind 
Sutton that just warms the soul.  Again, simple and perfect playing.  I love
the sound of cello, but this  
is far more than just a love for cello.  Summers is playing *with*
Sutton and interacting in ways that remind me of Scott Lafaro and Bill
Evans on their trio work.  I can't say enough about this track - it
warrants purchase of the entire album.

*Court and Spark* heads straight back to a traditional piano
accompaniment.  Quiet and down-tempo, this is done as a wonderful
ballad.  Following immediately is *Don't Go To Strangers* done with
just a slight latin touch.  Also done as a ballad accompanied by two
guitars, this could appear in my favorite movie, *Next Stop
Wonderland*.  *Little Green* goes back to accompaniment from *Turtle
Island* keeping the rotation ballad heavy with a classical bent to the
structure.

*The Drycleaner From Des Moines* takes things just a touch uptempo.
Wonderful flute work with Sutton's voice.  Very much a cool jazz
feel in the west coast tradition.  Maybe something that Chet Baker
might come up with.  Nice change up and one that took me by surprise.

Finally, the album closes with *Woodstock*, a quiet piano accompanied
ballad.  Definitely a story in the folk-inspired lyrics, but done with
jazz sensibilities.  A somewhat anticlimactic ending to a wonderful
album, but somehow the the perfect ending.

Buy this one.
