title: The Beach Boys

I'm sitting here listening and reading back issues of *Paste* and found
a fascinating read on The Beach Boys with some words Iâ€™ve never seen
before. I completely ignored The Beach Boys for most of my musical
life. When I was a serious jazzer listening to such serious jazz
groups like Spyro Gyra and Chuck Mangione (stop laughing), The Beach
Boys were just silly. During my New Age acoustic years, they were not
sophisticated enough. During my indie rock years, they were old. Then
I was a tried and true Beatles guy using the Beatles/Stones
classification system. You kind of get the picture. 

A few years back I went out and bought *Pet Sounds* when Brian Wilson
began emerging from his horrible fight with depression. I listened to
it carefully this time, both the mono and stereo mixes. My reaction
was nothing short of 'holy shit, what have I done. This is simply
amazing music that I should have paid attention to.' Well, I'm paying
attention to now and I would encourage everyone to do the same. 

In the *Paste* article, the most revealing thing I learned is that while
The Beach Boys are often thought of as the whitest band in the history
of rock and roll, nothing could be farther from the truth. Turns out
that they attended one of the most racially diverse schools in LA
where they heard lots of music that their african american friends
brought with them from the south. Remember, during this time there was
white radio and black radio - Elivs made a fortune by singing
so-called black music in a white body, but I digress. In particular,
The Beach Boys guitarist was a huge Chuck Berry fan and not at all a
fan of the beach guitar sound. Really? R&amp;B sounds in The Beach
Boys? 

I got out *Pet Sounds* again and listened closely to the guitar riffs
and sure enough, there are certainly elements of the surf sound, but
many of the guitar riffs could have easily come from R&amp;B
songs. Big surprise to me. 

The moral of the story is don't dismiss The Beach Boys, or any good
music for that matter, without giving a listen. A serious listen in
many cases. Oh, and top bashing Brian Wilson. Pitchfork and the rest
of you, just stop it. Amy Winehouse and Kurt Cobain are just two of
the way too many musicians who lost their battles with depression and
mental illness. Brian Wilson is to be celebrated because he
won. Although wounded, we still have him and he is a treasure.
