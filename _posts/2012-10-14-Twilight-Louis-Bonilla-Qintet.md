title: Twilight - Louis Bonilla Quintet
---
*Twilight* is a straight-ahead quintet album with a twinge of old-style
fusion, ala The Crusaders, anchored by the wonderful trombone work of
Louis Bonilla.  As much as I hate to admit it after years of band
rivalries, I've grown to love trombone.  Deep, warm sound - like the
tenor sax of the brass section.  I also tend to like the quintet
format a bit better than trio, but that's nothing but personal taste. 

*Twilight* opens the album with a definite RTF/Weather Report eerie
electric piano.  Tenor and trombone join quickly, but the electric
piano definitely sets the mood quickly transitioning into a nice
ballad sound.  Then about halfway through the intensity and tempo
shoots up with great trombone and tenor work with the piano working
behind them.  This track works really well. 

*The Moon and the Sun* follows with a more straight-ahead treatment and
switch to a traditional piano instead of the electric.  Vertigo takes
the tempo up just a bit and again trends toward a straight-ahead
sound. 

*Blind Faith* really takes the tempo and energy up, staying with more
traditional jazz feel.  Great dueling sax/trombone work about halfway
through.  Very nice work. 

*Visions* has the feel of an old Chick Corea tune - probably because of
the Fender electric piano, but also because of the rock tinged vibe.
Really nice work consistent with the rest of the album.  *Cork Grease*
is a slow-burning blues number switching from electric piano to
Hammond B-3.  Wraps up the album nicely.
