title: Build Anyway - The Rocketboys
---

Sometimes when I'm in a music buying frenzy I end up buying something
that goes on the shelf for awhile until I get through the music that
started the frenzy.  Such is the case with *Build Anyway* purchased at
the same time with new Minus the Bear and Sea and Cake.  Finally got
around to listening to this on a run the other day and was floored.
So much so that I'm listing it here before the new Minus the Bear or
Sea and Cake. 

*Build Anyway* is a pure pop/rock album.  iTunes puts it in Rock, but
it's a pop album to my ears in the spirit of fun. and Marching Band.
(Both bands that I really love.)
