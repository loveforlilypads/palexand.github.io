title: Beautiful Mechanical - yMusic
---

I had never hear of yMusic before I purchased *Beautiful
Mechanical*. I bought the album and let it sit for a month or so
before I got around to listening.  I'm a huge fan of playing classical
music and listening live, but never a fan of recorded classical music.
When I finally did start, I've listened to this album every day.  The
musicians are fantastic and the compositions wonderful. 

yMusic is somewhat eccentric in their instrumentation.  I can pick out
one trumpet, flutes (maybe a whistle?), clarinet, and what sounds like
a string quartet.  A couple of tracks also have a guitar and I hear a
french horn from time to time.  No percussion and no low brass.  As a
trumpet player, I have to say the trumpet has a classical sound that
is as perfect and clear as any I've ever heard. 

The composers are a mix of rising classical composers (Sarah Kirkland
Snyder, Gabriel Kahane, Judd Greenstein) and surprising folks from the
alternative world (Ryan Lott, Annie Clark, Shara Worden).  Some
amazing talent here - particularly the classical composers - that I'll
be listening to more from. 

Although the entire album is wonderful, there are two tracks that
stand out for me.  The title track composed by Ryan Lott of Son Lux is
a classical romp full of energy.  Almost playful in places, Beautiful
Mechanical makes me sit up in my chair and demands attention.  The
rhythmic dissonance used by the composer is incredibly effective. 

*Clearing, Dawn, Dance* composed by Judd Greenstein is the best song I
 have heard in the last 12 months of any genre.  Period.  It is a
 soaring piece that makes me think of Glass and Copeland.  Glass in
 the pulsating form of the song's structure and Copeland in the use of
 tempo and rhythm.  Similar to the title track, the energy of this
 piece is incredible and will force you out of our chair. 

Also worth a mention is *Proven Badlands* with wonderful trumpet and
flute working together, and *A Whistle, a Tune, a Macaroon* that is as
playful and fun as its title suggests. 

If this is the future of classical music, man have we got a great ride
ahead of us.  I will be looking for more by Greenstein, Synder, and
Lott as well as yMusic generally.  Great stuff.
