title: Walkin' On a Pretty Daze - Kurt Vile
---

You'd think that with a name like Vile, Kurt Vile would be the front
man for very angry punk band. Not so. Definitely not so. This is my
second album by Kurt Vile and both are consistently outstanding rock
albums in a similar vein as Josh Rouse with a bit more edge.

The sort-of title track, *Wakin On a Pretty Day* is a wonderful 9 minute
song that is both quiet and powerful. (I say sort-of as the album
title uses Daze instead of Day, something I found confusing
initially.) This is where I am most reminded of Rouse - a very
positive comparison from me. It's not common to hear a 9 minute pop
tune. I imagine that precludes any notion of radio play, but this is
kind of a pop mini-symphony and well worth your time. Imagine a nice
stroll on a warm, quiet summer day with an Allman Brothers jam on and
you've got the feel for this song.

*KV Crimes* takes the electric up, but not the tempo. Take away the
 Josh Rouse and substitute a bit of Nirvana and you get the idea. But
 *Was All Talk* takes us to Dire Straits in a nice way. Add some haze,
 up the tempo, add that indie style voice and you have a wonderful
 uptempo rock tune. The distinction from *KV Crimes* makes for a nice
 juxtaposition and definitely improves the effect. *Girl Called Alex*
 once again channels Mark Knopfler with nice reverb and a layer of
 gauze between the listener and the raw sounds of the guitar and
 voice.
 
It's pretty clear Kurt Vile wants to play his guitar and sing and
that's about it. There are radio tunes all over this album, but he
chooses to milk them for all they're worth rather than for the
requisite 3 minutes. I'll be playing this one quite a bit. I don't
know if it will occupy the rarified space that, say, *Nashville* does,
but it is definitely one of my favorites this year from an unexpected
place.
