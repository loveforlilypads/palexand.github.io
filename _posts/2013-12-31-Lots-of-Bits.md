title: Lots of Bits

For the first time I've been playing around with various sample rates
and resolutions.  I picked up new versions of *Gaucho* by Steely Dan, *Kind of
Blue* by Miles Davis, and *New Moon Daughter* by Cassandra Wilson.
*Gaucho* is 96/24 flac, *New Moon Daughter* is 192/24 flac, and *Kind
of Blue* is 192/24 AIFF.  So, I'm maximizing sample rates and sample
resolution on music remastered using the best known techniques.
Furthermore, all this music is stuff I know very, very well.

What did I hear?  First, I can't hear the difference between 96KHz and
195KHz sample rates.  Maybe there's something there I haven't focused
on yet, but I just don't think I can hear a difference and I would
challenge anyone to do so.  Second, I definitely *can* hear the
difference between 44.1KHz and 96KHz.  I *can* hear the difference
difference between Apple Lossless and 96/24 flac.  Cassandra Wilson
had bass I've never heard before, Miles Davis has resonances that I've
never heard before.  *Gaucho* is crisp and tight as expected from
Steely Dan.

However, I have to be on my big system to hear this.  Big system being
Benchmark DAC1, Audio Research LS26, Parasound A41 and Snell C/Vs.  I
have a much harder time picking anything out on my VOX, NuForce, Bryston
3NRB, PSB Alpha system at work.  Maybe it's there, but I certainly
don't notice like I do on the big system.  I've not listened using
headphones yet, but I think the limiting factor is the NuForce DAC.
It's really good, but it's not my Benchmark.  The PSBs are also good,
but they are small and may not be able to achieve enough resolution.

None of this is the least bit scientific, so don't out and replace
your mp3 and m4a files with high resolution without doing some serious
listening on your own.  Your mileage may vary!
