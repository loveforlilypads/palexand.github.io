title: At the Edge - John Crowley
---

John Crowley was not a name I had heard before discovering *At the Edge*
on iTunes.  I forgot what lead me there - most likely Ari Hoering -
but I've been enjoying this album quite a bit recently.  If you like
your jazz with a post-bop feel and lots of trumpet, fender-rhodes, and
tasty drumming, this is definitely an album for you. 

The album opens with a very short throw-away track called *In Real
Life*.  Basically very nice chords, but not much else going on.
Nothing bothersome, but rather uneventful.  Don't turn it off though
as it flows immediately into *Find Me* - my favorite track on the album.
It's a romp with double-time drumming underneath beautiful, simple
horn and keyboard work.  The trumpet and sax lines both float over the
drumming until the fender rhodes takes off on a double-time solo that
matches the drumming.   Definitely something to pay attention to. 

*...And Then One Day, It's All Over* takes things way down in tempo and
complexity.  It's a rather short track that features just trumpet and
bass.  Again, don't turn it off as it drops quickly into the title
track that is a more subtle version of *Find Me*.  Outstanding
percussion again with lots of rhodes and trumpet, but much quieter.
Still wonderful. 

Track 6 - *Sadness, Suffering, Hope, Triumph* starts a three track
sequence that I really love.  *Sadness, Suffering, Hope, Triumph*
starts as a simple ballad that is expertly performed.  The feature
soloist is the trumpet, carefully avoiding pyrotechnics for beautiful
sound and big notes.  Wonderful trumpet solo that features some great
chops.  After the trumpet solo, *Sadness, Suffering, Hope, Triumph*
takes off like a shot featuring the alto and fender.  The drummer is
right there as well.  The interplay between sax, keyboards and drums
is what really caught my ear. 

*Because You Believe* starts similarly to *Sadness, Suffering, Hope,
 Triumph* with a very quiet and simple keyboard solo.  Instead of
 taking off like a shot, it falls immediately into *Progress*.
 There's nothing particularly distinctive about Progress other than
 being an understated, great small ensemble track.  I'll mention the
 drummer again who is just kicking and working hard to great end. 

The remaining tracks are all quite good, with *Fixation* being my
favorite of the bunch.  Like *Find Me* it features the trumpet and alto
over a double-time drum track.  Once again very nice.  If you enjoy
lyrical trumpet, don't stop listening before the last track, These
Four Walls that ties a beautiful bow on the entire album. 

*At the Edge* makes me think of Chick Corea for some reason.  It's not
 like it sounds that similar, there's just a feel there that makes me
 think of him in a very good way.  John Crowley's trumpet work is so
 understated and wonderful.  No screaming runs into the stratosphere,
 just good, creative playing within the ensemble.  But what really
 makes this album is the drumming.  Wow. Ziv Ravitz is simply stunning
 without being over-the-top.
