title: Josh Rouse and The Long Vacations
---

Josh Rouse is a long-time favorite of mine.  Really great, laid back
pop music that kind of reminds me of Glenn Campbell in a very good
way.  1972, Nashville, and Country Mouse, City House being my
favorites. After a series of releases that I enjoy, but don't hit the
player that often Josh Rouse and the Long Vacations caught me a bit by
surprise.  It seems he has a band now, but he's returned to a sound
that reminds me of the early albums that are, in my opinion, as close
to perfect as you're going to get. 

Then opening two tracks are classic Josh Rouse.  *Diggin' in The Sand*
is a playful understated pop tune that opens with a quiet banjo and
voice, then builds into full instrumentation and sound.  Just like one
of those great James Taylor tunes.  *Movin' On* feels much the same -
quiet pop song with wonderful instrumentation that could come straight
off a Glenn Campbell album. 

*Fine Fine* changes gears a bit with a latin twine to it.  With a
fantastic bossa nova in feel to it I would swear it comes from the
*Next Stop Wonderland* soundtrack.  Then *To The Clock, To The City*
changes gears again back to the banjo backed simple voice that makes
you want to lay in a hammock and enjoy the sunshine. 

Skipping forward a few tracks, *Oh, Look What The Sun Did!* is my
personal favorite on they album.  Light and airy in classic Josh Rouse
style.  More uptempo than the earlier tracks, this one could appear on
any of Josh's albums and has the same feel as *Winter in the Hamptons*,
one of my favorite tracks of all time by any artist. 

With Josh Rouse and the Long Vacations, Rouse is back to what I
really, deeply love in pop music.  Great melody, great story, and a
kind of simplicity that is hard to achieve.  Although his other albums
after *Nashville* are great, this one really hits the mark for me.  Buy
it.
