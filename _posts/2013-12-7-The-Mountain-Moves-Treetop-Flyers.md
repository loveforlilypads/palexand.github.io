title: The Mountain Moves - Treetop Flyers
---

Just a quick note about this really nice, retro album by Treetop
Flyers.  I saw a review in Paste and pulled down their sampler as
I often do only to discover a reincarnation of the old pop group
America.  You remember America - *Horse With No Name* was a radio hit
from my childhood.  Anyway, *Things Will Change* could have been on an
America album straight up.  This is cool as I really like America, but
here's the odd thing - they're British. British as in not America at
all!  Kind of fun if you ask me.  Great album here.  You should buy it.
