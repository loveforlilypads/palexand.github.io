title: Chicago in The Hall of Fame
---
Finally.  My boycott of the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame can officially come to an end.  *Chicago* is in.  It simply took far too long for a band that defined a sound, was exceptionally popular in two different incarnations, and whose political activism was as unique as its music to make the hall.  Every pep band in the world plays *25 or 6 to 4*.  *Beginnings*, *Saturday In the Park*, and *Does Anybody Know What Time It Is?* are among the greatest pop/rock songs of all time.  11 number one hits and multiple number one albums.  Finally there is justice.

Now I'll start working for *Kansas*, but I think the case is less clear.  They defined progressive rock in the 70s and 80s, but I don't think had the influence of other bands.  For several years *Carry On My Wayward Son* was the most frequently played song on classic rock stations.  That should say something.

Today is a day for celebrating *Chicago* so we'll leave *Kansas* for another day.
