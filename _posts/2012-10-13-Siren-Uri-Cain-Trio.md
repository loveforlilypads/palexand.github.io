title: Siren - Uri Cain Trio
---

Excellent straight ahead post-bop trio work.  Very classic lines
throughout, but with enough twists to keep you listening.  *Green
Dolphin Street*, *Crossbow* and *Interloper* are particularly good up-tempo
tracks.  You can guess how *Green Dolphin Street* goes.  *Crossbow* and
*Interloper* are not tunes that I recognize.  Also worth mentioning is
*Succubus*, a great post-bop tune with nice twists and turns with
stylistic surprises.  *Smelly* has some Monk-esque feelings mixed with
some original ideas and movements. 

If you like your jazz trios straight-ahead, then Uri Caine Trio is
most definitely worth your time.
