title: Modern Vampire in the City - Vampire Weekend
---

I got this album from iTunes based on a one song preview and a rating
over 9 on Pitchfork. I never do that - it was a classic impulse buy. I
which all my impulses were this good!

*Obvious Bicycle* opens the album in a wonderfully understated way. A
quiet song, *Obvious Bicycle* has qualities of a gospel song that I
can't quite put my finger on. Regardless, this is an odd song to open
an album with. It sounds far more like a closing track. It is
wonderful and airy with lots of nice harmonies and just the right
amount of electronics underneath.

*Unbelievers* is where the album kicks into high gear. This romp is a
classic pop song with w driving rhythm line and light, peppy
vocals. (I'm using the word "peppy" in tribute to my
grandmother.). Wonderful organ work also gives it an oddly gospel
feel. Given the topic, unbelievers in the religious sense, this works
particularly well.

> Is this the fate that half of the world has planned for me?

For some reasons this hits home for me.

*Step* takes things down a level again with the feel of a nice, light
pop ballad. Harpsichord work and bells set a nice feeling for this
song. The vocals sound like they're coming through a vocoder, but it
works nicely. This is a high point on an album that is one giant high
point. 

> Wisdsom's a gift, but you'll trade it for youth.

Back up tempo with *Diane Young* and back to the 50s and a kind of beach
sound. Like the first tow the sound is subtle, perfectly mixed with
modern sounds right up to the *Wipe Out* guitar lick. The Beach Boys
might not record this one, but they'll sure like it. Another high
point and wonderful, nearly perfect song. *Diane Young* transitions
seamlessly into *Die Young* in a wonderful way. I'm not as fond of this
song as the previous three, but it works where it is and bring
things down in a good way. 

Taking things downtempo further is *Hannah Hunt*. While *Step* is a happy
ballad, *Hannah Hunt* is slower and more contemplative. 

*Everlasting Arms* could come from the great Paul Simon *Graceland*
album. Nice African pop baseline and drums relying heavily on the kick
drum and the tom. But this is not from *Graceland*. The main theme gives
way to sweet string arrangements to remind us where we are.
