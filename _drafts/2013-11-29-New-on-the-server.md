Lots of new music on the server since my last update.  Here's some of
it:

* *After Blue* - Tierney Sutton
* *Dinosaurs* - Open Trio
* *Dexterity* - Jasper Blom Quartet
* *Sometimes Forgotten, Sometimes Remembered* - Mansur Scott Harlem
   Quartet
* *Horizon* - Eyot
* *Sometimes I Wish I Were an Eagle* - Bill Callahan
* *Made Up Mind* - Tedeschi Trucks Band
* *Babba Yaga* - Futurebirds

Lots more as well.  At this point I'd have to say that Bill Callahan
and Tierney Sutton are my favorites in this list.  I'll write more on
them later, but check out *Both Sides Now* on *After Blue* and *Faith
/ Void* on *Sometimes I wish I were an Eagle* for brilliant new stuff.
