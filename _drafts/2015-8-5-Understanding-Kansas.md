title: Understanding Kansas
---

I end up having quite a few discussions with colleagues on the coasts and overseas about how I can live in a completely insane state like Kansas. Particularly given my political leanings.  There are lots of reasons. Lawrence is consistently rated among the top 10 college towns in the US and has a fantastic arts and music scene. Then there's 5 my commute my wife's 3 minutes commute. When the Oscar Meyer Wiener Mobile shows up in town it's front page news. Mainly it's my colleagues at KU who are outstanding scholars and better friends. But I digress.

Turns out its not nearly as insane here as the public caricatures make it out to be. Here's a [great article](http://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/09/magazine/the-kansas-experiment.html) from the NY Times by a native son who now lives and works on the east coast. It's more a human interest story than hardcore journalism, but it captures quite well what's happening in Kansas.
