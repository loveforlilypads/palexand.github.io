title: 662 January Travel
---
I will be required to do some travel to support my research projects
that will cause me to miss class January 28 and 30. Specifically, I
will be travelling to San Diego for a DARPA principal investigator's
meeting. KU is working with Adventium Labs on a research project to
define malice in printers, MFDs, routers and other network
appliances.  We're using planning and testing to predict malice that
might apear in system software based on capabilities that are
discovered.  If you're interested in this I am always happy to talk
about what we're doing in my research group.
