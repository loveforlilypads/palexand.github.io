It should be pretty clear from my initial set of prototype pictures that the room and the new gear don't exactly go together.  Using the bar in the back as an equipment rack and stacking the speakers in front of the wooden built-ins is highly non-optimal.  Enter Natural Breeze.  By far the best remodelers in Lawrence and as I would learn later, the best guys ever.
