title: Freedom Flight - Nicky Shrire
---
*Freedom Flight* is a jewel - brilliant jazz vocals.  Nicky has a
beautiful voice, but there are lots of those.  She also has simple but
sophisticated and interesting arrangements and fantastic musicians
behind her.  *Freedom Flight/Blackbird* sucked me in.  Material is quite
varied - a bit of everything from samba through a James Taylor cover.
A really good James Taylor cover I might add.  I will be on the
lookout for album number 2 from Nicky.
