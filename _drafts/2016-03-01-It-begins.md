title: It begins

The big upgrade begins with a call from the shipping company.  They've been told they have a residential delivery and are concerned that I'm going to be able to get my new gear off their truck.  They said 1400lbs of gear with the lightest box coming in at 70lbs.  I said not to worry.  I'm telling you, I was damn worried.

I get the call telling me the truck is on the wa.  My students, my friend Dan, and I show up to a semi pulling up to my driveway with some very heavy boxes and crates.  Thankfully everything is exceptionally well packed.  Wheels on the crates.  Everything is packed perfectly making the task much easier than it could have been.  20 minutes or so later,  have a garage full of boxes.  I don't have a clue what's in any of them yet, but the adventure starts for real.
