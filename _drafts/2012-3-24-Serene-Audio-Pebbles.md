title: Serene Audio Pebbles
---
I've been looking for desktop speakers for near field listening at my
computer forever.  I finally read enough reviews of the new Serene
Audio Pebbles self-powered speakers to give them a whirl and am quite
happy with them so far.  I love my Grado 225 cans, but there are times
when I want to work and not be strapped into headphones.  Thus, the
desire for desktop speakers. 

The Pebbles are, as the name implies, pretty tiny.  When I unboxed
them I was immediately concerned with the size of the drivers.  I'm not
a bass-head, but I do like some bottom end in my music.  The pebbles
are about 5" high by 4" wide.  The driver itself is exposed - no grill
- and is maybe 2" across.  I set them up and gave them an extended
listen the first night and have since listened on several occasions to
everything from *Gently Disturbed* by the Avishal Cohen Trio to today's
*Music for 18 Muscians* by Steve Reich.  For reference, I'm using output
from my MacBook Pro run through a NuForce mini-DAC.  My setup is not
quite what I want yet with the speakers about 3' away and about 2'
apart.  I'll work on that later. 

Right now I am exceptionally pleased with my purchase.  The sound is
not huge, but I've got my big system for huge.  The sound is quite
detailed - wonderful for classical and jazz - and very quick.  The
latter always being huge for me.  There is definitely more bass than I
expected, but not boomy or otherwise out-of-control.  Listening to
*Music for 18 Musicians* I've heard some detail that has not come out
with headphone listening, I believe due to driver size.  Some very
subtle bass work.  Part of this I'm sure is paying attention to the
music and that this album is somewhat new to me, but I'm really
enjoying it.  This is my first foray into self-powered speakers - a
decision that I did not make lightly.  I'm quite happy with that
decision as well.  My desk is not huge and I didn't want to spend
another $500 on a stand-alone amplifier.  I'm noticing zero noise in
the amp and it definitely will drive the speakers hard if I ask it
to. 

Do the Pebbles perform as well as my Snells?  Of course not.  Do they
perform as well as my Grado cans?  Most definitely, but in a different
way.  There are still times I want to listen to headphones.  This is
definitely a purchase I would make again and highly recommend these
speakers for near field listening.  I'd still go for something bigger
to fill a room, but for my desk I don't know how I could have done
better than this - particularly at the $500 price point I set.
