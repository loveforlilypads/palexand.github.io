It's definitely a jazz guitar month this month.  New stuff downloaded
this weekend: 

* *The Next Step* - Kurt Rosenwinkel
* *Words Unspoken* - Gilad Hekselman
* *New For Now* - Jonathan Kreisberg
* *Unlikely Stories* - Lage Lund
* *Bert's Playground* - Ari Hoenig
* *Locked In a Basement* - Heernt
* *Taking the Soul for a Walk* - Dafnis Prieto Sextet

Virtually all guitarist led small ensembles with the notable
exceptions of Ari Hoenig and Heernt.  Kurt Rosenwinkel is a new
discovery for me - I am highly impressed.  Similarly with Heernt, but
far more outside than Rosenwinkel.  Most of the others I have work by
or I've been stalking for awhile.
