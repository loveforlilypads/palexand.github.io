Just a quick note on Zara McFarlane's album *Until Tomorrow*.  Very nice
classic jazz vocal album featuring Zara and a small ensemble.  I like
most of the tracks pretty well.  Of particular interest are *Mama Done*,
*Chiaroscuro*, *Desire*, and *My Favorite Things*.  *Desire* is by far my
favorite track on the album - a nice, slow classic piece featuring
Zara and piano.  Pretty good album overall if you like vocal jazz.
